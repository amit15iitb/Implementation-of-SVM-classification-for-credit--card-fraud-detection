Detectiing Credit card fraud from the huge amount of dataset
A perfect project to learn Data Analytics and apply machine learining algorithms detect the fraud accuracy.

Given Data sets
1:creditcard.csv

The Problem Statement
The data scientist at Credit card data have collected over the huge banks across the diffrent cities.And also,certaion attributes of each bank and people and city have been defined. The aim is to build a machine learning model to find out the fraud people ratio and accuracy of the such big dataset . Create a Supoprt vector model that can alayse and calculate the farud accuracy .
It is the perfect project for basic Support vector machine learning . In this projec the reader will come to know 1: Data Exploration 2: Data Cleaning 3: Feature Engineering 4: Creating Models

Following machine learning algorithms are used
1:Support vector machine model 2:Convex optimization model for Langrange optimization
